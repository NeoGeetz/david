//not sure could be 1000 or 1000000 or even 1 bil (multiple gigs of ram)
//programmers encourage each other to use the dynamic memory section of programs

//know exactly what you want and it's a small size
//using stack is probably fine, dynamic allocation would also be fine, really just a design
//choice at that point and have to do with what you're considerations are

//not sure, but pretty damn confident it won't be tooo big.
//maybe advised to use the stack and decide an upper limit that you can commit to

//not sure but pretty sure that value range will be in between 1 and 300 or 1 and 100
//just make an array of the size of the upper limit and then you can index based on the 
//actual "variable" size

//may want to do error checking if you are sure about the limit but not sure if the
//index values you play with will be correct values (in correct range)
