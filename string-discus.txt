"string" ?

what is a string ?

it is a *loose* term that is tossed around in programming contexts
"strings" are understood to be the way to store ~linguistic "words"

"abc @#$% ok"

the "idea" of a string

the common "implementation" of a string

no rules on how the "idea" of a string is implemented

"lots" of different techniques out there


try this:...

A) a string is an array of characters but the first character is the length of the string
B) a string is an array of characters and the last character is always the value "0" (so we can figure out the length if we loop)
C) combo of both, a string is an array of characters with size marked at the beginning but *also* null terminated

D) a string is a block of 256 characters (can never be too long)
   the last character marked as 0

E) a string is a block of 256 characters (can never be too long)
   store an extra "size" parameter in the struct definition


F) a string is a block of 256 characters (can never be too long)
   store an extra "size" parameter in the struct definition
   also use null byte at end

struct our_string {
    int  size      ;
    char data[256] ;//easy, just set a limit to how big a string can be
} ;

//say we just want to get the input first and parse into a nice structure after
char lineOfBoats[MAX_BOATS * MAX_STRING_LENGTH] ;
char lineOfBoats[MAX_BOATS * 256]               ;


our_string lineOfBoats[MAX_BOATS] ;

char idea_memory[4]    ; //"idea"
char idea_memory[5]    ; //"idea", \0
char idea_memory[1000] ; //"idea", \0 .....
char idea_memory[MAX]  ; //"idea", \0 .....

"idea" where is it stored, where does it live ?
